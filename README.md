# Go with tests

My walking through [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) to get up to
speed again on Go.

## Decisions

* I make some low-level decisions differently from the original author as I complete the exercises.
* I omit documentation comments and examples for Go Doc as described [here](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/integers#examples)
. Looks neat for a more involved project, but not the focus right now!
